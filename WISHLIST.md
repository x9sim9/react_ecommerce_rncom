# Wishlist

So here is the current list of features I hope to add to the project in the future.

While its far too much work for one developer as this project grows and more developers come on board the features will continue to grow.

## SEO and Performance

- Google Page Speed Optimisation
- Seo Optimisation tools

## Frontend

- Payment Carrier integrations
	- Stripe
	- Paypal
	- Google
	- Apple
	- Amazon Pay
	- and hopefully many more
- 3rd Party User Authentication Services
	- Next Auth
	- Open Auth
	- AWS and Azure Auth
	- etc...

### Admin Panel

(Currently in Development)

- Manage Products and Categories (UI)
- Manage Orders and Make Changes (UI)
- Manage Customers (UI)
- Admin User Authentication (UI)

## Backend

### Features

- **i18n Language Support** - While the Frontend is fully i18n compliant the backend only supports one language
- **Devise for authentication** - while some projects will use 3rd party authentication, having the optional ability to use devise for authentication would offer better security
- **AWS / Azure / Heroku image hosting support** - images uploaded directly to 3rd party hosting instead of the web server
