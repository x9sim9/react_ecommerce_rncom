# Branches

As the project has only been recently released the Core branch will be the only branch available but as contributions are made we will split the project into the branches described below.

### Core Branch

This branch is maintained by the [Author](https://github.com/x9sim9) exclusively, over time commits from the community and experimental branches will move into the core branch but expect this to be at a much slower rate due to time constraints. Every new commit will be fully audited, tested and maintained by the author.

If you would like features developed for this project or would like to hire the [Author](https://github.com/x9sim9) for custom software development work please drop me a message and I will get back to you as soon as I can :-)

## Future Reference

NOTE: The master branch is in continual development and may have regular breaking changes. At the moment it will reflect all the new features that will be coming to the core branch in the future.

### Experimental Branch

All new contributions will be committed here expect this branch to be unstable and potentially have conflicts but will also have the most up to date features.

### Community Branch

I am currently looking for some maintainers who want to manage this branch unfortunately I don't have the time to keep up with all the community development features. I would ask that maintainers are experienced Developers that have worked in industry and understand the importance of good software development practises.
