# Getting Started - Frontend

NOTE: it is recommended to setup the backend first and start the backend server before setting up the frontend - [Frontend Instructions](../frontend/GETTING_STARTED.md)

Once installed checkout the [Developer](DEVELOPER.md) page for features and useful developer features.

### Requirements

- Node JS (check the .nvmrc file for the current version)

### Installation

- copy `.env.example` to `.env.development`
	- check the file in case you want to make any changes
- type `npm install` to install the Node JS libraries

### Server

- start the server with `npm run dev`
- you can access the backend by http://127.0.0.1:3021
- you can also access developer information here http://127.0.0.1:3021/--/

One important point to mention is that this project was built on the new `app` router introduced in NextJS 13 and so many tutorials have not yet updated their documentation to cover this.
