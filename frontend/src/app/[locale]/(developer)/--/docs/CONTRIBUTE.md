As a freelance developer can I use this in more than one project?
: Yes but each project requires a fresh contribution and it can not be a copy and paste job, each project needs to be functionally and visually distinct

As a software development company can I use this in more than one project?
: You need to contact the author who will endeavour to offer fair licensing terms

As a software development contractor can I use this in more than one project?
: This is a legal grey area as typically when you are a contractor all work created by you is the property of the company you work for, so you would fall under the same restrictions as the Software Development company. i.e. yes for single projects but use of this project must be disclosed to your employer so they are fully aware of the restrictions.
