# LICENSE

So you have arrived here a little confused by the license on the main page and want to know what it all means, don't worry I have tried to keep this simple and concise.

So this project is free to use in any single development project as long as you as a company or an individual [contribute](CONTRIBUTE.md)  in some small way to the project.

However this does not mean a company can slap their logo on it and resell it over and over to customers, or integrate this work into a software package that is resold to multiple customers. This also means that this project cannot be forked into another project that is then redistributed.

If you are a company and want to use this in multiple projects then please contact the [author](https://github.com/x9sim9) as I am more than willing to offer fair licensing terms.

NOTE: The [CONTRIBUTIONS.md](CONTRIBUTIONS.md) must be accessible via /contributions in any published site, and a link to the contributions page needs to be on one page of the site that is publicly accessible and should be included in any search engine sitemap files. However where this link goes doesn't matter and we don't want it to get in the way of any work. You are also welcome to add your company information to this page but all contributions must be listed.

### FAQ

How do I contribute?

: Its simple, fix some bugs, add a new feature or improve the code in some way. Please read the [Contribute](CONTRIBUTE.md)  page

Who is the project for?

: **1. Freelance software developers**
: Consider this as a free beer for everyone working hard in the freelance software community. This is a solid 2 months worth of work at least to build from scratch so you can take it a little easier and perhaps make a little more money. Just remember its your responsibility to disclose the restrictions of this license to your employer.

: **2. New developers or enthusiasts**
: It is very hard when you are still learning to get your hands on high quality code that is easy to understand and follows good software development practises, so this project is intended to teach good habits.

: **3. Software development companies**
: So many software development companies only exist due to the hard work of unpaid overworked Open Source maintainers. This project is a just a reminder to give a little back to the Open Source community.

Why do you have this license?

: I have worked with open source software for years and have been very grateful that so many software engineers have built such a thriving ecosystem.

: I have also seen so many instances of people taking the hard work from others and profiting from it without ever giving back to the community that worked so hard to make it, giving up their free time while usually juggling full time jobs and families and all the other stresses of life.

: Making this "contribute ware" means everyone has to contribute in some small way whether a freelance developer or a corporation.

As a freelance developer can I use this in more than one project?
: Yes but each project requires a fresh contribution and it can not be a copy and paste job, each project needs to be functionally and visually distinct

As a software development company can I use this in more than one project?
: You need to contact the [author](https://github.com/x9sim9) who will endeavour to offer fair licensing terms

As a software development contractor can I use this in more than one project?
: This is a legal grey area as typically when you are a contractor all the work created by you is the property of the company you work for, so you would fall under the same restrictions as the Software Development company. i.e. yes for single projects but use of this project must be disclosed to your employer so they are fully aware of the restrictions.
