# Getting Started

There are three versions of the project available:

- Core
- Experimental
- Community

For more information on the different branches see [Branches](BRANCHES.md)

As the project is only recently released you won't find any releases but this may change in the future.

Once downloaded you will need to follow the instructions for both the **backend** and **frontend** folders.
