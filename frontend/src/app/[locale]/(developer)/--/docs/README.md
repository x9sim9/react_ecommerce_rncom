## License

This project has a rather unique license which I would class as "contribute-ware". What this means is that this project requires a developer using this code to contribute to the project in some small way. This could be adding a small feature, fixing some bugs or becoming a maintainer. Don't worry this includes companies too but there are some restrictions.
