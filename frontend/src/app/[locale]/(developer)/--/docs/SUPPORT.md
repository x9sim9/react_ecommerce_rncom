# Support

If you need support or would like additional features built please contact the [Author](https://github.com/x9sim9) who works as a software development contractor and would be happy to schedule work around other projects.

It terms of bugs and issues I will do my best to support the project but as this is purely on a volutary basis around work and life commitments I may not be able to personally respond to every issue.

Please report any bugs or issues to the [github issue page](https://github.com/x9sim9/react_ecommerce_rncom/issues) however I cannot support those unfamiliar with NextJS or Ruby on Rails and there are many great online resources to help with this.
