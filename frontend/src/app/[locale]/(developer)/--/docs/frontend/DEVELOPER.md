| `npm run dev`               | Start the frontend server on [http://127.0.0.1:3021](http://127.0.0.1:3021)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |  
| `npm run lint`              | This will run the `eslint` linter to check for coding errors, it is recommend to have rubocop run automatically on save as it will keep the code formatted and help resolve errors as you work. It is recommend to use an Editor/IDE that supports linting as you code such as `Jetbrains Webstorm/Rubymine` or `VSCode`. You can also use `npm run lint_watch` to automatically update the linter as you make changes to files                                                                                                                                      |  
| `npm run test`              | Run all cypress tests in Headless Mode. NOTE: A server must be running for cypress to work successfully. e.g. `npm run dev`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |  
| `npm run typecheck`         | This will run typescript type checker to check for type related errors. Note there are 2 separate type checkers one for the project and another for Cypress testing this command runs both. You can use `npm run typecheck_cypress` and `npm run typecheck_project` to run them separately. You can also use `npm tun typecheck_watch` to automatically update type check as you make changes to files                                                                                                                                                               |  
| `npm run watch`             | This combines both linting and typechecking into a single command that updates as you make changes to files                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |  
| `npm run codegen`           | This reads the graphql configuration from the backend and the graphql queries and mutations on the frontend and create the relevant types in the `src/graphql/schema` folder. The contents of this folder are automatically generated but we keep them in git to keep track of changes over time, however if you get a git merge conflict its perfectly fine just to delete this folder and run `npm run codegen` again                                                                                                                                              |  
| `npm run cypress_dev`       | Runs the Cypress testing app in dev mode, for building and running tests. NOTE: A server must be running for cypress to work successfully. e.g. `npm run dev`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |  
| `npm run build_translation` | When managing the default translation we split the translation over multiple files in the `src/translations` directory. This command will merge the default translation into a single file and place it in the `messages` folder as `en.json` it is important however to delete this file as it will override the translations defined in the `src/translations` directory. We generate it so we can then create other translations from it in the `messages` folder such as `en-US.json` and `de-DE.json` translation files which live in the `messages` directory. |  
| `npm run build`             | Build the project ready for production `next build`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |  
| `npm run start`             | Start the frontend server in production mode (after being built) on [http://127.0.0.1:3021](http://127.0.0.1:3021) when deploying to a live site make sure to use port `80` or if using `nginx` configure it to route to port `3021`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
